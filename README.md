Remind
======

A Swift CLI app to quickly deal with your reminders.

Remind also makes use of [Argue](https://github.com/interstateone/Argue), a really basic command-line argument parser in Swift.

## Usage

`remind --help`

## Installation

You've got two options:

- Download the latest binary [release](/releases) and put it in `/usr/local/bin`.
- Download the source, `git submodule update --init`, and build the project with Xcode. Note that you can set up different arguments to pass to the binary by option-clicking the Run button in Xcode. This is handy for testing.
